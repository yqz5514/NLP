# Class_Ex1:
# Lets consider the 2 following senteces
# Sentence 1: I  am excited about the perceptron network.
# Sentence 2: we will not test the classifier with real data.
# Design your bag of words set and create your input set.
# Choose your BOW words that suits perceptron network.
# Design your classes that Sent 1 has positive sentiment and sent 2 has a negative sentiment.

# Class_Ex2:
# Use the same data in Example 1 but instead of hardlim use logsigmoid as transfer function.
# modify your code inorder to classify negative and positive sentences correctly.

# Class_Ex3:
# The following function is given
# F(x) = x1^2 + 2 x1 x2 + 2 x2^2 +x1
# use steepest decent algorithm to find the minimum of the function.
# Plot the the function in 3d and then plot the counter plot with the all the steps.
# use small value as a learning rate.

# Use the following corpus of data

# sent2 :  'Natural language processing has nice tools for text mining and text classification. I need to work hard and try a lot of exericses.',
# sent3 :  'Ohhhhhh what',
# sent4 :  'I am not sure what I am doing here.',
# sent5 :  'Neural Network is a power method. It is a very flexible architecture'

# Train ADALINE network to find  a relationship between POS (just verbs and nouns) and the the length of the sentences.

# Class_Ex5:
# Read the dataset.csv file. This datset is about the EmailSpam.
# Use a two layer network and to classify each email
# You are not allowed to use any NN packages.
# You can use previous NLP packages to read the data process it (NLTK, spaCY)
# Show the classification report and mse of training and testing.
# Try to improve your F1 score. Explain which methods you used.
# Hint. Clean the datset, use all the preprocessing techniques that you learned.
